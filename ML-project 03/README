First, use descriptive statistics, visualization methods to describe and interpret the variables and possible association amongst them. 

Secondly, model Balance_1500 by the explanatory variables Income, Limit, Rating, Cards, Age, Education using the following models:
- logistic regression,
- linear discriminant, and 
- quadratic discriminant.

Thirdly, find and compare the probability of (Balance_1500), for the following values, using all three aforementionned methods:
Income 	Limit 	Rating 	Cards 	Age 	Education
63 	8100 	600 	4 	30 	13
186 	13414 	950 	2 	41 	13

Lastly, build and compare the confusion matrix, the accuracy score and the AUC using all observations.
